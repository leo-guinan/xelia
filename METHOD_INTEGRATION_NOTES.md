# Method Integration Notes

## Key Findings

1. **No Client-Side SDK**: Unlike Plaid, Method does not provide a client-side JavaScript SDK that can be loaded via CDN.

2. **Server-Side Integration**: Method uses the `method-node` npm package for server-side integration.

3. **Connect Flow**: Based on the method-node documentation, Method Connect appears to work through server-side API calls rather than a client-side widget.

## Correct Implementation Approach

Instead of trying to load a client-side SDK, we should:

1. Use the server-side `method-node` SDK to create connections
2. Handle the entire flow through API calls
3. If Method provides a hosted connect experience, redirect users to it

## API Endpoints Needed

- `/api/method/create-entity` - Create a Method entity for the user
- `/api/method/create-connection` - Create a connection for the entity
- `/api/method/sync` - Sync account data

## Next Steps

1. Remove the client-side Method Connect hook
2. Implement server-side connection flow
3. Update UI to handle server-side flow
